# StatusMonkey Lead Mobile

A React Native (Expo) mobile app version of the StatusMonkey lead finder concept.

## What this app includes

- Lead list dashboard optimized for mobile screens.
- Search by company, contact, or email.
- Status-based filtering chips.
- Tap-to-open lead detail modal.
- Mock lead data so the app runs without backend setup.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Expo dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
3. Open on device/simulator via Expo Go or emulator shortcuts.

## Scripts

- `npm run start` – start Expo
- `npm run android` – open Android emulator
- `npm run ios` – open iOS simulator
- `npm run web` – run web target
- `npm run typecheck` – TypeScript checks

## Notes

Network access from this environment was restricted, so the upstream repository could not be fetched directly. The app is a clean mobile implementation scaffolded in this repository.
